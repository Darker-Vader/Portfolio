About me
Hello! I'm Emmanuel Ibegbu, a passionate Web Developer with a knack for creating beautiful, functional, and user-friendly websites. With over 2 years of experience in front-end development, I specialize in bringing ideas to life through writing code.

My journey started with a liking for technology and design, which led me to learn languages like HTML, CSS, Javascript, and python. Today, I enjoy working with frameworks such as React and Nide.js, crafting seamless experiences for users worldwide.
